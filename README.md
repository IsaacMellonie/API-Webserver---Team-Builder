## Installation and Setup

If you’ve ever played social team sports, you’ll know how tough it can be to get everyone to communicate whether they’re available each week. There’s a few reasons for this, apart from the obvious heel-draggers who will always cause team admins to pull their hair out, there’s no easy way to create and manage a team for social sports leagues. There’s some simple solutions which use social media as a way to send out polls or ask for a show of hands so to speak. Then there’s the old method of starting a group chat and texting everyone days before the game. All of these solutions are ok but there could be a much more effective solution for something that seems quite simple. That’s where this API can help. By designing a backend for player management, this system will make organising teams, leagues, and sports easier for admins and league organisers. 

Using this system to manage team and league organisation, will also solve the issue of record keeping in relation to game outcomes and player attendance. Which, in some leagues, requires a player to attend a required number of games to be eligible to play in the finals. Thus nullifying the possibility of calling ring-ins on the day of an important match. Another problem area this API will help, will be with team communication. 

Players (Users) must complete the Signup process. Once their phone and email are stored in the database, the system could send out automated alerts with reminders of upcoming game times. 

This API aims to create a management system which tracks players, teams, leagues, and sports by keeping a record on a game by game, league by league basis. The relational database will utilise tables that store users, teams, leagues, and sports.
